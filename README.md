This project helps to get data of any Twitter account using a perl script. The perl script uses modules : Net::Twitter module and Data::Dumper. 

1. You would need to have an account in Twitter to get the details required in get_data.conf file.
2. Edit file get_data.conf.template with the details thus acquired and copy it to get_data.conf and then run ./get_data.pl. 
3. Getting an account and getting details should be a matter of 5-10 minutes.
4. If the perl modules(mentioned above) are not installed on your computer, use command "cpanm Module_name" in your command line to install.
